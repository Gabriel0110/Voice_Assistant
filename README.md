# Voice_Assistant
Voice Assistant for my computer using Google Speech Recognition.

Acts similar to Amazon Echo where, once running, it can be activated by a specific phrase: "Hey Jarvis"

Once activated, it is currently setup to say "How can I help you", then awaits for a command.  Currently, I have only implemented a reminder system to help with my terrible memory.
